- a JSON data is like a resources in RESTful thinking
- every resource has an associated URL = resource's unique address

URL convention:

if root URL = www.example.com/api
if there is a resources called note with identifier 10
then it's URL = www.example.com/api/notes/10

POST - notes = create a new resource
DELETE - notes/10 = removes note 10 from resource
PUT - notes/10 = edit the entire note 10 in resource
PATCH - notes/10 = replace part of note 10 in resource
